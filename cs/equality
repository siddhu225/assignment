Equality In strings:

1).We can do this problem using stack.

Suppose the example is ABABABAAABBBAABB

2).At first the stack is empty.first We will push A 

Here are two conditions:

1).If A is there on Top of the stack If the next character is we have to push is B then we will POP otherwise We will Another A to the Stack and update the Top.

2).The above condition with is Same with B.


->If the number of A's and B's are equal then the stack will be empty otherwise the number of A's and B's are not equal.
